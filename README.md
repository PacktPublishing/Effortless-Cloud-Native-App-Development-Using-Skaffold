**Simplify the development and deployment of cloud-native Spring Boot applications on Kubernetes with Skaffold**

## What is this book about?
Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, drastically improving how we deploy and manage cloud-native apps. Although it has simplified the lives of support professionals, we cannot say the same for developers who need to be equipped with better tools to increase productivity. An automated workflow that solves a wide variety of problems that every developer faces can make all the difference!. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
Overcome challenges faced while working in an inner development loop using Skaffold
Accelerate your development workflow using Skaffold
Understand Skaffold's architecture, internal working, and supported CLI commands
Build and deploy containers to Kubernetes using the Skaffold CLI and Cloud Code
Deploy Spring Boot applications to fully managed Kubernetes services such as Google Kubernetes Engine using Skaffold
Explore best practices for developing an app with Skaffold
Avoid common pitfalls when developing cloud-native apps with Skaffold in Kubernetes
